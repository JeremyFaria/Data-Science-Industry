# Data-Science-Industry
I divided my analysis into 2 parts, in part 1 I modeled the salaries within the data science industry, in part 2 I did some EDA within the industry

# Part 1:
I used the country codes data set and the salaries data set to create a model prediciting the salaries with the data industry with linear regression and ridge regression. I set my predictor to salaries_in_usd and the rest of the features were qualititative information about their careers. The country codes data set allowed me to allocate regions to each observation in the salaries dataset. I also compared the bias and variance of these respective models. To prep my data for these regressions I did some data cleaning and feature engineering.

# Part 2: 
I did some exploratory data analysis on programming languages used in the data industry using the kaggle_survey_2022_responses.csv data set. This data set was a survery where some questions you could have multiple answers. This was filled out by over 20000 people who worked in the data industry. I had to do some data cleaning, plotting and transformations in order to get insights.
